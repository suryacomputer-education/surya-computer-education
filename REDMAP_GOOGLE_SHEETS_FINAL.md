## AERON update — 2026-08-28
- **MockTests** now stores Course + Subject ID + Subject Name. Run `setupSuryaSheets()`; missing headers are added safely without deleting existing data.
- **ContactMessages** now stores `Reply` and `Replied At`. Admin can read, reply by email, and delete messages from `admin-contact-messages.html`.
- **Admin login security** now uses a trusted-device approval challenge for every new browser/device: password alone does not create a session. An already logged-in trusted Admin device must tap YES/NO and approve the displayed two-digit number.
- **Courses** already had backend CRUD; a full Admin Course management panel was added to `admin-courses.html`.
- **Mock Test** admin panel is subject-wise and uses active Course Subjects. Student Mock Test Center shows the student's own course tests first and provides an All Courses button. The CBT question palette/timer/scoring remains server-backed.
- **Result** grade thresholds are synchronized to A+ 90, A 80, B+ 70, B 60, C 50, D 33. Disabled Result Subjects are not returned.
- **UI** includes responsive desktop/mobile panels, centered focused form controls on mobile, Enter-to-next-field for normal form controls, and stronger dark/light contrast across cards, popups, inputs and mock-test panels.
